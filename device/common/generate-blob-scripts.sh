# This script auto-generates the scripts that manage the handling of the
# proprietary blobs necessary to build the Android Open-Source Project code
# for a variety of hardware targets

# It needs to be run from the root of a source tree that can repo sync,
# runs builds with and without the vendor tree, and uses the difference
# to generate the scripts.

# It can optionally upload the results to a Gerrit server for review.

# WARNING: It destroys the source tree. Don't leave anything precious there.

# Caveat: this script does many full builds (2 per device). It takes a while
# to run. It's best # suited for overnight runs on multi-CPU machines
# with a lot of RAM.

# Syntax: device/common/generate-blob-scripts.sh -f|--force [<server> <branch>]
#
# If the server and branch paramters are both present, the script will upload
# new files (if there's been any change) to the mentioned Gerrit server,
# in the specified branch.
